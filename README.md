## Reflective Summary

While I worked on this project independently, I followed the protocol that our team had collectively planned beforehand. 
As I developed a chatroom based on the protocol, I gained a deeper understanding of computer networks. 
Effective communication with the team was crucial to ensure the usefulness of the protocol and successful implementation in our individual projects.
This project taught me the significance of debugging and adding comments to code. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of collaborative work, 
as my team of seven members planned the protocol together.
